				This is the primary menu that will be served aboard the Mars Express spacecraft
				during the duration of the mission. While it may not be as varied as the meals we
				enjoy on Earth, every meal has been carefully crafted to provide the astronauts with
				the essential nutrients they need to maintain optimal health and performance during
				their long journey to Mars. From rehydrated meals to specially formulated snacks,
				each item has been selected to withstand the rigors of space travel and to offer a
				taste of home.
